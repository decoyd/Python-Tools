	Description:
		A very lovely way of quickly generating all possible combinations
		of four digit strings. Useful for bruteforcing something.
		Increasing the `repeat` parameter of the product() function would
		increase the resulting string length and hence, the time to gene-
		rate that string.
		Sample output:
			0000
			0001
			0002
			...	snip-snip ...
			9998
			9999

import itertools

for combination in itertools.product(xrange(10), repeat=4):
    print ''.join(map(str, combination))
